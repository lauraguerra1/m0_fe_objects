# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - I enjoyed using outside resources like MDN and W3Schools to learn on my own and add to my understanding. I am feeling confident in both my technical skills and in my ability to use Google as a tool.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - I have gotten into a steady routine and have updated my calendar to keep up with it. I started taking a 15-30 minute break at lumch time instead of eating at my desk. I have maintained, for the most part, the same routine on a daily basis, and that has helped me to stay on track. I am able to pay attention to those times in which I enter an unproductive struggle and need to reset, which allows me to feel less distracted when I am working.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - I learned how to print the keys and valued of an object, how to add and remove keys from an object, create key-value pairs, and how to check the value of a key in an object. There was a lot of new information introduced in this segment, both in the functions and he objects assignment. I want to make sure I keep practicing to both **retain** *and* **build** on this information as Mod 1 approaches.
